% Directions:
% Write the code to satisify the following directions. For each part, store
% your answer in the variable that is specified within the parentheses. 
%   Ex. Add 1 + 1. (GT)
% That means store the value of 1 + 1 in the variable GT, like so:
%   Ex. GT = 1 + 1;

% Given Input Variables (3):
%   1. (double) num - A positive integer. 
%   2. (double) vec - A row vector of numbers with at least 5 elements
%   3. (double) vec2 - Another row vector of numbers 

% 1. Create a vector that consists of "num" equally spaced numbers between 
% 2 and 11 (inclusive). Use the linspace() function. (A)
A = linspace(2, 11, num)

% 2. Create a vector that goes from 3 to "num" in steps of 2. Use the 
% colon operator. (B)
B = 3:2:num

% 3. Create a row vector of length "num" that consists only of 6s
% ([6 6 ...]). Use the zeros() or ones() function. (C)
C = ones(1, num) .* 6

% 4. Create a column vector of length "num" that consists of random numbers 
% that are uniformly distributed between 2 and 9. (D)
D = (2) + (7) .*rand(num, 1)

% 5. Find the number of elements in the vector "vec." (E)
E = length(vec)

% 6. Find the smallest element in "vec" (F), and the index at which it is
% located (G).
[F G] = min([vec])

% 7. Sort the vector "vec" and store the sorted vector in (H).
H = sort(vec)

% 8. Concatenate vectors "vec" and "vec2", in that order (I).
I = [vec vec2]

% 9. Reverse "vec2" and store the resulting vector in (J).
J = vec2(end:-1:1)

% 10. Find the last element of "vec2" (K). Do it without using the 
% length() function.
K = vec2(end)

% 11. Starting with the first element, find every other element in "vec2." 
% That is, find every element that occurs at an odd-numbered index (L).
odds = 1:2:length(vec2)
L = vec2(odds)

% 12. Find all of the numbers in "vec2" that are less than 5. (M)
small = vec2 <5
M = vec2(small)
