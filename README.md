# Matlab Code
These are all the homework submissions from the Intro to matlab course I took freshman year. I really enjoyed learning to code, and to make things fun for me, I used themed variable names. This of course was not fun for my TAs, but hey, I got a laugh out of my homework. And this wasn't a class where everyone can say that.
