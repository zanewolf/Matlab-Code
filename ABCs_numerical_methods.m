% Problem Parts:

% a) interp1. Find the y values that correspond to the xi values using
% linear interpolation from the vectors x and y. (A)
A=interp1(x, y, xi);

% b) spline. Find the y values that correspond to the xi values using
% the spline method from the vectors x and y. (B)
B=spline(x, y, xi);


% c) polyfit. Find the coefficients of the fifth order polynomial that best
% fits the points represented by vectors x and y. (C)
C=polyfit(x, y, 5);


% d) polyval. Evaluate the polynomial found in part c at the points in the
% vector xi. (D)
D=polyval(C, xi);

% e) diff. Approximate the derivative, dy/dx, for the vectors x and y. (E)
E=diff(y)./diff(x);

% f) Approximate the second derivative for the vectors x and y. The
% x vector should consist of all except for the last index of the original
% x vector used in the previous part. (F)

F=diff(E)./diff(x(1:end-1));


% g) cumsum. Find the cumulative sum of the elements in x. (G)
G=cumsum(x);

% H) trapz. Find the area under the curve represented by x and y by using
% the trapzoidal method of approximation. (H)

H=trapz(x, y);
% I) cumtrapz. Find the cumulative area under the curve represented by x
% and y by using the trapzoidal method of approximation. (I)
I=cumtrapz(x, y);
