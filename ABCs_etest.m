% Directions:
% Please review the CS1371 ETestTutorial.pdf before answering these
% questions. It is your responsibility to read this guide so that you are
% amptly prepared for the test. 
%
% For the following questions, you should answer either true or false. Make
% sure not to include any quotations (' ') in your response. For each part,
% store your answer in the variable that is specified within the
% parentheses. 
%   Ex. Add 1 + 1. (GT)
% That means store the value of 1 + 1 in the variable GT. 

% 1. The test will use MATLAB, which you should have on your computer. (A)
A = false

% 2. The green checks on the practice test will not appear on the real 
% test. (B)
B = true


% 3. My answers will not be saved until I explicitly save them by clicking
% "Save Answer". (C)
C = true

% 4. It is not necessary for me to enter my answers for fill-in-the-blank
% questions in MATLAB format; I can rely on the computer to infer my
% meaning. (D)
D = false
% 5. When I am done with my test and I have shut down my computer, I am 
% free to leave. (E)
E = false

% 6. Submission of an electronic exam is equivalent to handing in a paper
% test to the professor; in both cases, once you turn in your exam, the 
% professor reserves the right to disallow you to take back your test and
% change any answers prior to grading. (F)
