% ABCs of Cell Arrays
%
% Directions: Write the code to satisify the following directions. For each
% part, store your answer in the variable that is specified within the
% parentheses. 
%   Ex. Add 1 + 1. (GT)
% That means store the value of 1 + 1 in the variable GT. 
%
% Given Input Variables:
%   1. ca1 - A cell array of at least size 4. 
%   2. ca2 - A cell array.
%   2. D - A cell array of at least size 3. 

% 1. Creating. Create a cell array with the length of 4 where the first 
% cell contains the vector [true false false], the second cell contains the
% string 'Georgia Tech', the third cell contains the number 23, and the
% fourth cell contains a cell with the vector [1 1 2 3 5 8] (A).
vector = [true false false];
string = ['Georgia Tech']
number = 23
cellvec = {[1 1 2 3 5 8]}
A = {vector string number cellvec}



% 2. Empty Cell Arrays. Create an empty cell array. (B)
B = {}

% 3. Accessing and Indexing. Create a cell array that contains the 2nd and 
% 4th cells of the cell array ca1. (C)
C = ca1([2, 4])


% 4. Deleting. Delete the third cell of the cell array D. For example,
% if D = {[1 0 1 0], 'I love CS1371', {[11,12,13,14]}, [true true false
% true]}, after running the code, D should equal {[1 0 1 0], 'I love
% CS1371', [true true false true]}.
D(3)=[]


% 5. Class/Type. What is the class/type of the first cell in ca2? (E)
E = class(ca2(1))


% 6. Class/Type. What is the class/type of the contents inside the first
% cell of ca2? (F)

F = class(ca2{1})

end
