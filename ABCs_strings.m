% ABCs of Strings
%
% Directions:
% Write the code to satisify the following directions. For each part, store
% your answer in the variable that is specified within the parantheses. 
%   Ex. Add 1 + 1. (GT)
% That means store the value of 1 + 1 in the variable GT. 
%
% Given Input Variables:
%   1. str1 - A vector of characters (string)
%   2. str2 - A vector of characters (string)
%   3. vec1 - A vector of numbers
%   4. alph1 - A character that is a letter other than 'z' or 'Z'
%   5. var1 - A variable whose class is unknown
%   6. double1 - An integer 
%   7. str3 - A vector of characters that represents a number (string)
%   8. str4 - A vector of characters (string) that contains words separated
%             by commas

% 1. ASCII Values & Character Mapping. What are the ascii values of str1?
%    (A)
A = double(str1)

% 2. Casting to strings. Cast vec1 to a character array (string). (B)
B = char(vec1)

% 3. Slicing and Concatenation. Make a new string which is the
%    concatenation of all of str2, then a space, and then all of str1. (C)
C = [str2, ' ', str1]

% 4. Arithmetic Operations. Find the letter following alph1. Your
%    answer should be in the same case as alph1. (D)
D = char(alph1+1)

% 5. Logical Operations. Is the second letter of str2, which is an ascii
%    character, the same character/letter as alph1, which is also an ascii
%    character? The answer should be a logical true or false. (E)
b = str2(2)
E = alph1==b

% 6. ischar(). Is var1 a string (character array)? The answer should be a
%    logical true or false. (F)
a = class(var1)
F = ischar(a)

% 7. sprintf. Use sprintf to create the string:
%
%    'alph1 is the letter <alph1>' 
%
%    where <alph1> is replaced by the actual character stored in the
%    variable alph1. For instance, if alph1 equaled b, the string would be:
%
%       'alph1 is the letter b'
%    (G)
G = sprintf('alph1 is the letter %s', alph1)
% 8. strcmp(). Are str1 and str2 the same string? (H)
H = strcmp(str1, str2)

% 9. strcmpi(). Are str1 and str2 the same string if you ignore case? (I)
I = strcmpi(str1, str2)

% 10. class(). What is the class of var1? (J)
J = class(var1)

% 11. num2str().  double1 is variable representing a number.  Convert
%     double1 to a string representing that number. For example, if double1
%     is the number 5683968, you would convert it to the string '5683968'. 
%     (K)
K = num2str(double1)

% 12. str2num(). str3 is a string that represents a number.  Convert str3 
%     to that number using str2num. For example, if str3 is the string
%     '711', you would convert it to the number 711. (L)
L = str2num(str3)

% 13. strtok().  str4 is a string with words separated by commas, like so:
%                       'word1,word2,word3'
%     Use strtok to find the first word in the string and store it in (M); 
%     store the rest of the string in (N).
[M, N] = strtok(str4, ',')


% 14. strtok(). Store the second word in the original string as (O) and 
%     store the rest of the string in (P).
%     (Hint: you should use the variable (N) and indexing is not
%     necessary)
[O P] = strtok(N, ',')
