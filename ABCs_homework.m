% Directions:
% 1. Read the CS 1371 HW Guide.  Failure to follow the guidelines set
%    forth in the guide will result in a loss of points on your assignment 
%    and a forfeiture of your right to request a regrade.
%
% 2. Answer the following statements by setting the variables immediately
%    following the questions to 1 (yes/true) or 0 (no/false).

% EXAMPLE 1.  CS 1371 is a course taught at Georgia Tech.
% example1 = 1; 
%
% EXAMPLE 2. CS 1371 teaches students how to program in C.
% example2 = 0;

% 1. I have read the CS 1371 HW Guide and I understand the guidelines for
% completing and submitting assignments.
A = 1;

% 2. When I am doing a homework problem, I should follow the directions
% carefully and always make sure that I am correctly naming variables,
% files, and functions. Also, case and spelling matter when naming
% variables, files, and functions.
B = 1;

% 3. It is OK if my code has errors in it.
C = 0;

% 4. Testing my code won't help me complete the assignment.
D = 0;

% 3. I should use the workspace window, not the command window, to ensure 
% that my variables have the correct values.
E = 1;

% 4. After I submit my assignment I should always check to see if I
% received a confirmation e-mail. If I didn't, that means my assignment
% wasn't submitted properly. 
F = 1;

% 5. If I have a bad homework grade, I should automatically e-mail the HW 
% STA and ask him or her to change it.
G = 0;

% 6. After a homework assignment is graded, I have 1 week to appeal my 
% grade to my TA. If they do not respond, I have an additional week to 
% contact the HW STA.
H = 1;

% 7. If T-square crashes, I should e-mail my code to my TA.
I = 0;

% 8. If I am confused by the directions on a Homework, I should just make a 
% guess on what the homework wants me to do.  
J = 0;

% 9. I don't expect to always get feedback before the Resubmission due
% date. Getting feedback is just a privilege, not a guarantee.
K = 1;

% 10. I am required to turn in something for the second submission.
L = 0;
